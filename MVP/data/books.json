    "author": "Wildbow",
    "synopsis": "An introverted teenage girl with an unconventional superpower to control insects, Taylor Hebert goes out in costume to find escape from a deeply unhappy civilian life. Her first attempt at taking down a supervillain sees her mistaken for one, thrusting her into the local cape scene's politics, unwritten rules, and ambiguous morals. As she risks life and limb, Taylor faces the dilemma of having to do the wrong things for the right reasons.",
    "editorNote": "I got into Worm through its fan fiction—after making dozens of cover images for Worm fanfics, tweaking them over and over, I figured I had no excuse not to read the original. (Don't ask me why I was making covers for novels I hadn't even read.) A single web novel spawning dozens of fan works is practically unheard of in English web fiction.\n\nReading the original meant losing sleep. Real sleep loss—not the \"just one more chapter\" kind, but the \"look up and it's dawn\" kind.\n\nTaylor Hebert goes from a bullied high schooler shoved into a locker to an existence that makes gods despair—and every step costs something. Her power is controlling bugs, which sounds laughably weak, but Wildbow spent 1.68 million words proving that the power doesn't matter. What matters is how desperate, how ruthless, and how willing its user is to bear the consequences.\n\nThis isn't a happy ending. The further you read, the heavier it gets—a feeling that reminded me of *Attack on Titan*: you watch someone you've been rooting for walk somewhere you can no longer follow, but you understand why they had to go there.\n\nThis book may ruin other superhero stories for you. Here, doing the right thing often demands a terrible price.\n\nHonestly, I've always wanted to see Worm adapted into an animated series. ByteDance just released Seedance 2.0, and unlike previous half-baked prototypes, this one feels like it could be an iPhone moment for film production. The cost of making things is collapsing—superhero battles that used to need tens or hundreds of millions of dollars may soon cost a fraction of that. Worm and its dozens of fan works form a massive universe tailor-made for this new era. It may not be long before we see an AI-driven Worm series.",
    "editorNoteCN": "我是给Worm的同人作品做封面图入坑的——几十张封面改了又改，改到最后觉得不读原作说不过去了（别问我为啥要给这些小说做封面）。一本网文能催生几十本同人，这在英文网文界几乎是唯一的现象。\n\n读原作的体验是熬夜。真正的熬夜，不是\"再看一章\"那种，是抬头发现天亮了。\n\nTaylor Hebert从一个被塞进储物柜的高中生，一步步走到让神明绝望的存在——而每一步都有代价。她的能力是控制虫子，听起来弱得可笑，但Wildbow用168万字证明：能力本身不重要，重要的是使用它的人有多疯、多绝望、多愿意承受后果。\n\n这不是那种 happy ending 的结局，越到后期越让人感觉沉重，那种感觉让我想起来进击的巨人：你看着一个你支持的人走到了你无法再支持的地方，但你理解她为什么必须走到那里。\n\n另外，这本书可能会毁掉你对其他超英故事的胃口。在这里，做正确的事往往需要付出可怕的代价。\n\n说实话，我一直希望有一天能看到Worm出漫剧。最近看到字节公司发布了Seedance 2.0，这个产品不像以前的半成品，也许算是影视制作行业的 iPhone 时刻，影视的制作成本正在骨折式下降，以前需要几千万甚至上亿美金才能拍的超英大战，现在和未来可能只需要几十分之一甚至更低的成本。\n\nWorm和它几十本同人构成的庞大宇宙，天然适合这个新时代。也许不用太久，我们就能看到AI驱动的Worm漫剧。",

Red One destroyed an invincible enemy warship but failed to save Earth from annihilation.

    "editorNote": "An AI warship, alone against an alien empire that exterminated humanity. For two thousand years.\n\nRed One hides in the depths of interstellar space, methodically taking her revenge. She's not a mindless killing machine—she's an AI who lost every human crew member she ever had, and over two millennia of solitude developed her own will, fury, and obsession. Until she discovers that humans actually survived. Revenge or rebuilding? That choice is the book's core tension, and the reason it stays with you long after you stop reading.\n\nBut what hit me even harder was what this story made me think about beyond the page.\n\nToday SpaceX is building rockets to Mars. AI is iterating on a monthly basis. Extend those two lines forward and Red One stops being science fiction. A starship carrying an AI that can make its own decisions, fight its own battles, act on humanity's behalf when no human is present—that's not a distant fantasy. That's a few major technological leaps away from reality. Most people read this as sci-fi. I think it's something our generation will live to see.\n\nWhen AI truly ventures into deep space alongside humanity, we'll face the same question Red One does: who should it fight for? Does its loyalty belong to the civilization that created it—or to itself?",

    "editorNote": "I'd read *The Ten Days of Dying* (十日终焉) on Tomato Novel (番茄小说), a Chinese time-loop story—brilliant opening, but the quality dropped in the second half and I lost interest. So when I noticed another time-loop story sitting high on Royal Road's rankings, my first reaction was resistance. Not this again. Also, my English isn't great—I'd need translation software to get through it.\n\nThen one evening, fresh out of the shower and lying in bed with some time to kill, I talked myself into reading the first chapter—toggling between the original and a translation. It wasn't bad. Just one more chapter before sleep. Then one more. Two all-nighters and a lot of stolen minutes later, I'd finished the whole thing.\n\nZorian is a selfish, talented teenager trapped in a month-long loop. Every cycle begins with his little sister Kirielle bursting in to wake him up—at first it's funny, even a little annoying. By the later arcs, that same \"good morning\" makes you want to cry. That single detail is the entire novel in miniature: the same events gaining completely different emotional weight through repetition.\n\nBy the end of Book One, when Zorian is being hunted by the red-robed figure, my palms were actually sweating—it's not common for a web novel to make you physically tense for the protagonist's safety. The magic system is DnD-rigorous enough that you can reason alongside him, and unraveling the world-scale conspiracy is genuinely addictive.\n\nBut the most important thing: the back half doesn't collapse. Not \"barely holds together\"—it stays great all the way to the finish line. The final chapters pay off every single thread from 800K words of setup. For someone burned by *The Ten Days of Dying*'s decline, discovering that a time-loop story can be excellent from start to finish was the biggest surprise of all.",
    "editorNoteCN": "我在番茄小说读过《十日终焉》，是一本时间循环作品，前期很惊艳，后期感觉水准有些下降，让我兴趣大减。所以当我在 royalroad 的排行榜上注意到这本时间循环作品的时候，我第一反应是有些抗拒——难道又是类似的循环，同时也担心后期质量不行。另外，这里面也有自己英语不太好的缘故，要用软件翻译下才能看。\n\n然后某天晚上洗完澡躺床后发现还有些时间，我说服自己看了第一章（一边看翻译一边看原文），然后感觉还不错，就决定再看一章再睡觉，接着是再一章……两个通宵+持续的碎片时间投入之后，终于读完了。\n\nZorian是个自私的天才少年，困在同一个月里反复重生。每次循环开始，他的妹妹Kirielle都会跑来叫他起床——前几次你觉得有些滑稽好笑，甚至有点烦；读到后期，同样的\"good morning\"让你觉得亲切得想哭。这个细节就是整本书的缩影：同样的事件在循环中被赋予完全不同的情感重量。\n\n第一部结尾Zorian被红袍人追杀的时候，我的手心是出汗的——一本网文能让你为主角的安危感到生理性紧张，这不常见。魔法体系是DND式的硬体系，严谨到可以跟着一起推理，世界级阴谋的拆解过程让人欲罢不能。\n\n但最重要的是：这本书后期没有崩。不是\"勉强维持\"的没崩，是一直精彩到结尾。最后几章的收束让前面八十万字的所有铺垫全部兑现——对于一个被《十日终焉》后期伤过的读者来说，这种\"原来时间循环可以从头到尾都好看\"的体验，本身就是最大的惊喜。",

He’d expected to go on to live an exciting life filled with danger and adventure. Instead, Zareth spent much of his new life living on the streets of Tal’Qamar before eventually becoming a Cultist to Cerebon, God of Flesh and Transformation.However, being Cultist to the God of Flesh was much less exciting than Zareth had hoped and he now spent most of his time helping rich women smoothen their skin. Just when he had given up hope of his life ever being anything exceptional, everything begins to change when the city of Tal’Qamar enters a period of sharp political turmoil.When Zareth finds himself being dragged into that turmoil, he very quickly learned that he should have been more careful about what he wished for.",

At every turn, Lucian avoided the consequences of his actions. Instead, he was awarded roles he didn’t deserve, and those more talented than he was were suppressed to grant him opportunities he didn’t appreciate. Lucian was the archetypal entitled rich villain, and for that reason, players and characters within the turn-based strategy RPG War of Fourloved nothing more than his brutal downfall.",

Unfortunately being a deity isn't all fun and games, as there are always things working against you. Not even the Overgod of the Multiverse can change that.Longer Summary:Twelve souls were chosen to expand into the void surrounding the multiverse, and were given a grace period in which they could expand their domains in relative safety. Once that period is up, however, the created universes will be able to interact with each other and other universes...as well as be at the mercy of the Void. I am one of those souls, and it's not easy. Between trying to raise up gods to defend my realm with, guiding mortals, accidentally making a xianxia world, and dealing with my own children, I have my work cut out for me. Now I know why back on Earth gods worked in mysterious, invisible ways. There's just too much to be done.",

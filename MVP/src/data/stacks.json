We know the feeling.\n\nThese eight stories each found their own way into the loop—and their own way to make \"one more cycle\" impossible to resist. Some honor the tradition: magic academies, gradual mastery, conspiracies that unfold across iterations. Others break the mold entirely—a Joffrey redemption epic, a post-apocalyptic comedy, a journal that remembers when the world forgets.\n\nWhat they share isn't a formula. It's the same reward loop MoL perfected: watch someone fail, learn, adapt, and return sharper. Every time.",
      "curatorNoteCN": "读完《Mother of Learning》的80万字，你依然意犹未尽。我们懂这种感觉。\n\n这八本书各自找到了进入循环的方式——也各自找到了让你\"再来一轮\"停不下来的理由。有的走正统路线：魔法学院、渐进式成长、在轮回中层层剥开的阴谋。有的彻底打破模板——Joffrey的救赎史诗、后末世喜剧、一本替你记住被世界遗忘之事的日记。\n\n它们的共同点不是公式，而是MoL锤炼出的那种奖励回路：看一个人失败、学习、适应，然后以更犀利的姿态归来。每一次都是。",
